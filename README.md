# Data Visualization with Python

This is the Capstone Project for Course 9, _IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project_. Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera. Available here: https://www.coursera.org/programs/jda20232t1-z1hse/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?collectionId=Wxyxq

We will take on the role of a Data Analyst with a global IT and Business services firm. In this role, we will be analyzing several datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies. We have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, our organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, we will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

### Task 1

Our first task is to collect data for the technology skills that are most in demand from various sources including job postings, blog posts, and surveys. We will begin by scraping internet websites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.

### Task 2

Once we've collected enough data we will take the collected data and prepare it for analysis by using data wrangling techniques like finding duplicates, removing duplicates, finding missing values, and inputting missing values.

### Task 3

Now that the data is ready we will apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends like: What are the top programming languages that are in demand? What are the top database skills that are in demand? What are the most popular IDEs? And Demographic data like gender and age distribution of developers.

### Task 4

In the fourth task, we'll focus on choosing appropriate visualizations based on the data we want to present using charts, plots, and histograms to help reveal our findings and trends.

### Task 5

For task 5, we will employ Cognos/Google Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards to help analyze and present the data dynamically.

### Task 6

For the final task, we will use our storytelling skills to provide a narrative and present the findings of our analysis.

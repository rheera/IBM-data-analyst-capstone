In this assignment we will continue working with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create a dashboard. We will create some visualizations and add them to dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics. In this dashboard we will create the following:

A **Current Technology Usage** tab containing:

1. Top 10 Languages

3. Platforms
4. Top 10 WebFrames

A **Future Technology Trends** tab containing:

1. Top 10 Languages desired for the next year
2. Top 10 Databases desired for the next year
3. Desired platforms for the next year
4. Top 10 WebFrames desired for the next year

A **Demographics** tab containing:

1. Respondent classified by gender
2. Respondent count for countries
3. Respondent count by age
4. Respondent count by gender and classified by education level

## Dataset

The dataset we are going to use in this task comes from the following source: https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/ under a ODbL: Open Database License.

We are using a modified subset of that dataset contained in the two CSV files (m5_survey_data_demographics.csv and m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv).
